### Mini Firefox

# What is this?

This is stripped down version of firefox, that doesn't have:

- pingsender.exe
- default_browser_agent.exe
- updater.exe
- other useless files

It also comes with pre-set about:config, slightly optimized for privacy and disabling update + telemetry (will add more to it overtime)

Feel free to check it out!
